\title{Maddison Project Database}
\usage{
maddison_project()
}
\value{
A tidy \code{tibble} containing 6 columns.

The \code{key} column agreggates:

\itemize{

  \item \code{real_gdp_pc}: Real GDP per capita (US$ 2011) with multiple benchmarks. This is a suitable indicator for cross-country income comparisons;
  \item \code{real_gdp_pc_2011}: Real GDP per capita (US$ 2011 benchmark), which is advisable for cross-country growth comparisons; and
  \item \code{pop}: population in thousands.

}

Unfortunately, for some periods of time the data had to be estimated. In those cases, \code{i_cig} and \code{i_bm} provide the type of method used. \code{NA} means that no method was need.
